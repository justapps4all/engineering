# Introduction



In those articles we are going to do a review to state of the art of the current Software Architecture.

At the moment we have two popular technologies at the top level, Java EE and MEAN (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node). MEAN Development is moving from second place to first place due to the intrinsic scalability spirit. This is because most of the code run in the client side, instead of the server side. 

As you should know, server are scalables, you can buy new servers, but budget usually is not scalable too much. HTML5 MEAN technologies help you to reduce the data center cost.

We are going to review the incoming technologies for Enterprise Web Applications development.
