In those articles we are going to do a review of state of the art of the current Software Architecture.

At the moment we have two popular technologies at the top level, Java EE and MEAN (MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node). The second one, MEAN Development, is moving from second place to first place due to the intrisic escalability spirit. This is because most of the code ir run in the clien side, insteado of the server side. 

As you should know, server are scalables, you can buy new servers, but budget usually is not escalable too much. HTML5 MEAN technologies help you to reduce the data center cost.

- ES6 / ES2015
- Node
