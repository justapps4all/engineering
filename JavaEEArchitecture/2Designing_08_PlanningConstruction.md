The **critical path** is a set of dependent tasks that must complete on time for
the project to complete on time

 

Common Mistakes

-   Going straight to code

-   Permitting a moving target

-   Not correcting personnel assignment mistakes

-   Saving integration testing activities until the end of the project

 

Improving your Project Plans and Estimates

-   Track your time

-   Don’t discard estimates and time tracking records from past assignments and
    projects

-   Have a colleague review your estimates
