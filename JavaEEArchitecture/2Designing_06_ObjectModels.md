The application architect is responsible for facilitating design discussions,
which should involve the business logic and presentation-tier developers in the
design process

**Identifying Objects**

-   Identify the most important constructs

-   Don’t bother with attribution or relationships at this stage

-   As objects are identified, record persistence requirements

-   Objects identified at this stage are high level

 

**Turning Objects into Classes**

-   After identifying objects, you need to identify which layers they pertain to

-   Define separate classes for each object in each layer

-   Determining Relationships

-   Don’t document formal relationships to value objects or entity objects

 

**Identifying Attributes**

-   Avoid declaring derived attributes

 

**Identifying Methods**

-   Assume that all documented attributes will have accessors, getters and
    setters

-   Omit relationships to Objects in the JDK

-   Forget about generating code from UML

-   Don’t attempt to micromanage the coding when determining methods

 

The amount of modeling performed should be just enough to support the initial
development effort
