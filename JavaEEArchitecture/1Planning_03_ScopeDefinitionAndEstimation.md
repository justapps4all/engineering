# Planning: Scope Definition And Estimation



Get agreement on the use case from the project sponsor

Document any assumptions made in determining project scope

Basic of Estimating

-   Estimate in terms of the slowest resource on the team

-   Should be proportionally balanced

-   Should be expressed in terms of the number of work hours

-   Consider the time need to set up the different environments

-   User developer coding and unit test by 2.5

-   Validate estimations with historical data

 

### An Algorithm for Estimating

1.  Quantify the application; web pages, batch jobs, reports, database tables,
    and external application interfaces.

2.  Estimate coding and unit-testing time for each use case

3.  Multiply the base estimate from step 2 by 2.4 to account for analysis and
    testing activities for each user story or use case

4.  Inflate the estimate by 20% for each additional developer on the project.
    Each developer added to a project adds communication and coordination time
    (Brooks, 1995)

5.  Review you estimates with the development team

 

Estimate tracking documents the extent to which the project is on-time and
on-budget.

Estimate tracking documents the effect of re-allocating resources to other
projects.

Tracking estimates enables you to improve them on future projects.
