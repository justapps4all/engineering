Component requirements

-   Component Quality: Shorten development time and effort, shorten expected
    maintenance, generic and work as advertised.

-   Making Components Easy to Use

-   Limit the instructions for basic tasks to a one-page cheat sheet

-   Minimize the number of statements necessary to perform basic tasks

-   Separate the classes meant for public consumption from those needed
    internally by the API

-   Limit dependencies on other APIs

-   Avoid throwing “checked” exceptions

-   Making Components Easy to Configure and Control. Minimize the number of
    properties a user must configure

-   Minimize the required complexity on any needed XML documents

-   Limit installation and configuration instructions to a one-page cheat sheet

 

### Resolving Open Source Technical Issues

1.  Search the product’s bug list.

2.  Search the Internet

3.  Upgrade to the latest version

4.  Evaluate competing products

5.  Debug your test scenario

6.  Modify component code to fix the problem. This should be treated as an
    option of last resort.

 

### Mitigating Political Risk by using Open Source

-   Suggest a commercial software component along with open source alternatives
    and keep any documentation of the decision

-   If an open source decision is ever questioned, you can frame the issue as a
    group decision and point to budgetary advantages

-   Track which open source products you use and keep source as well as binary
    distributions.

-   Identify competitors to the open source product.

 

### Component Usage Guidelines

-   Minimize the classes directly using third-party components with direct
    competitors
